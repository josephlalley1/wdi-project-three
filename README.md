# Project 3: GigHub

### Overview

GigHub is a platform for venues to add live music events, and the standard user can mark whether they are going to the event or not, and see if their friends are going to be attending the same events.

### Project Brief

Your app must:
- Use Mongo, Node & Express to build a server-side API
- Your API must have at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
- Your API should include all RESTFUL actions for at least one of those models
- Include authentication to restrict access to appropriate users
- Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document
- Include automated tests for at least one resource
- Use Angular to build a front-end that consumes your API
- Use SCSS instead of CSS
- Use Webpack & Yarn to manage your dependencies and compile your source code

### Trello

Our group used Trello a lot for this project, giving each thing a card and moving them along when finished. This allowed us all to stay on top of the work.

### Challenges and Problems

- My biggest personal challenge of this project for me was that I didn't have much experience in group work and at the beginning I struggled with it. I think I picked up how to work better in a group quickly and we overcame this challenge together.

---

### Wins

- Adding a password verification system, where the registration page had rules to what a password could include, and if the password didn't pass those tests then the user would be unable to register. (For example, a password must be 8 characters long).

- Our group managed to get working maps, and that was a very difficult thing for us, so it was very satisfying for it to come through.


---

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- I would like to add a verification system where the administrators of the site are able to decline / accept venue registration requests, so that every event added to the site is by a verified venue.

- In addition to the verification system, I would love an administration panel where the owners can see the statistics of the site, such as the total amount of events currently on the site.
